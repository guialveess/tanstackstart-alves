## 2. Core Architecture

This application utilizes Next.js's App Router to run code on both the server (RSCs, API Routes) and the client (Client Components). Igniter.js is integrated as a structured API layer within the Next.js project.

### 2.1. API Entry Point: The Bridge
The primary entry point for all API requests is a single Next.js Route Handler:
-   **File**: `app/api/[[...igniter]]/route.ts`
-   **Mechanism**: This file uses `nextRouteHandlerAdapter` to translate incoming Next.js requests into a format Igniter.js understands, and vice-versa for responses. It exports handlers for all HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.). All requests matching `/api/*` are directed here. You will rarely need to modify this file.

### 2.2. Igniter.js API Layer: Feature-Based Structure
All backend business logic resides within the `src/features` directory, following a **Feature-Sliced Architecture**.
-   `src/igniter.ts`: The central configuration file where the `igniter` instance is created and global adapters/plugins are registered.
-   `src/igniter.router.ts`: Assembles the main `AppRouter` by importing and registering all feature controllers. **This file is the single source of truth for your API's structure.**
-   `src/features/[feature]/controllers/`: This is where business logic lives. Each controller defines API actions (`query`, `mutation`, `stream`).

### 2.3. The Universal Type-Safe Client
The file `src/igniter.client.ts` defines the **type-safe Igniter.js API client**. This is the primary way the frontend interacts with the backend.
-   **Auto-Generated**: This file **MUST NOT be edited manually**. It is a build artifact that perfectly mirrors the API defined in `igniter.router.ts`. It is regenerated automatically on change by the dev server.
-   **Universal Operation**: The client is isomorphic and works in all Next.js contexts.
    -   In **React Server Components (RSC)**, you call API actions directly (e.g., `await api.posts.list.query()`). This performs a direct function call on the server, bypassing HTTP for maximum performance.
    -   In **Client Components** (`'use client'`), you must use the provided React Hooks (`.useQuery()`, `.useMutation()`, `.useRealtime()`). These hooks make standard HTTP requests and manage the entire client-side state lifecycle (loading, error, caching, etc.).

---

## 3. Backend Deep Dive: Core Igniter.js Concepts

### 3.1. The Igniter Builder (`igniter.ts`)
The application instance is configured using a fluent builder pattern. This provides a guided, type-safe setup.

```typescript
// src/igniter.ts
export const igniter = Igniter
  // 1. Define the base context shape
  .context<IgniterAppContext>()
  // 2. Attach a structured logger
  .logger(logger)
  // 3. Enable the Redis-based Store (for cache and pub/sub)
  .store(store)
  // 4. Enable the BullMQ-based background jobs system
  .jobs(REGISTERED_JOBS)
  // 5. Enable the OpenAPI documentation and Igniter Studio
  .docs({
    openapi,
  })
  // 6. Set the base URL and base path for the API
  .config({
    baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNITER_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
    basePath: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNITER_API_BASE_PATH || '/api/v1',
    // You can add any more config and access before with igniter.config.[any_property] (Fully type-safety)
  })
  // 7. Finalize the configuration and create the instance
  .create();
```

### 3.2. Context: Dependency Injection
The **Context** is a type-safe dependency injection mechanism.
-   **Base Context (`src/igniter.context.ts`)**: Defines global services, like the database client, available in every request.
-   **Dynamic Extension**: **Procedures** (middleware) can return data, which gets merged into the context for subsequent steps, providing a fully-typed, request-specific context.

```typescript
// Example: An auth procedure adding a `user` object to the context.
export const authProcedure = igniter.procedure({
  handler: async (_, { request }) => {
    const user = await getUserByToken(request.headers.get('Authorization'));
    if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
    // This return value is merged into the context.
    return { user };
  }
});

// Example 2: Same, but with options

type AuthOptions = {
  required: boolean;
}

export const authProcedure = igniter.procedure({
  handler: async (options: AuthOptions, { request }) => {
    const user = await getUserByToken(request.headers.get('Authorization'));
    if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
    // This return value is merged into the context.
    return { user };
  }
});

// In an action that uses this procedure:
getProfile: igniter.query({
  use: [authProcedure()], // Or [authProcedure({ required: boolean })]
  handler: ({ context }) => {
    // `context.user` is now available and fully typed.
    // `context.database` is also available from the base context.
    return context.user;
  }
})
```

### 3.3. Controllers & Actions
-   **Controller (`igniter.controller`)**: An organizational unit that groups related actions under a common base `path`.
-   **Action**: A single API endpoint.
    -   `igniter.query()`: For `GET` requests (fetching data).
    -   `igniter.mutation()`: For `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` requests (changing data).

### 3.4. Validation
Igniter.js uses a two-layer validation approach.
1.  **Schema Validation (Zod)**: For validating the **shape and type** of incoming request `body` and `query` parameters. This happens automatically before your handler runs. If validation fails, a `400 Bad Request` is returned.
2.  **Business Logic Validation (`Ensure` plugin)**: For asserting **runtime conditions** inside your handler (e.g., checking permissions, verifying a resource exists). This replaces messy `if/throw` blocks with clean, declarative assertions that provide type-narrowing.

```typescript
// Example of both validation layers
updatePost: igniter.mutation({
  // 1. Zod schema validation
  body: z.object({ content: z.string().min(10) }),
  use: [authProcedure({ required: true })], // Ensures user is authenticated
  handler: async ({ request, context, response }) => {
    const post = await context.database.post.findUnique({ where: { id: request.params.id } });

    // 2. Business logic validation
    context.plugins.ensure.toBeDefined(post, "Post not found");
    context.plugins.ensure.toBeTrue(post.authorId === context.user.id, "You do not have permission to edit this post");

    // Set response headers or status
    response.setHeader('X-Last-Modified', new Date().toISOString());
    response.setStatus(200);

    // After these checks, `post` is guaranteed to be defined.
    // ... update logic
  }
})
```

### 3.5. Understanding the Code: A Properties Breakdown

To understand what we just wrote, here's a detailed breakdown of the properties for both the `controller` and the `actions` within it.

#### Controller Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| name | string | Yes | A descriptive name for the controller, recommended for clarity and debugging |
| path | string | Yes | The base URL segment for all actions within this controller. For example, `/greetings` |
| description | string | No | A high-level summary of the controller's purpose, useful for documentation |
| actions | object | Yes | An object containing all the API endpoints (`Actions`) for this controller |

#### Action Properties

Igniter.js has two types of actions: `igniter.query()` for data fetching (GET) and `igniter.mutation()` for data modification (POST, PUT, DELETE). They share some properties but have key differences.

##### Query Action (`igniter.query`)

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| name | string | No | A descriptive name for the action, useful for DevTools and documentation |
| description | string | No | A summary of what the action does |
| path | string | Yes | The URL segment for this action, appended to the controller's path. Final URL: `/greetings/hello` |
| query | object | No | A Zod schema to validate URL query parameters |
| use | array | No | An array of middleware to run before the handler |
| handler | object | Yes | The function containing your business logic |

#### Mutation Action (`igniter.mutation`)

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| name | string | No | A descriptive name for the action |
| description | string | No | A summary of what the action does |
| path | string | Yes | The URL segment for this action |
| method | string | Yes | The HTTP method to use, e.g., `'POST'`, `'PUT'`, `'DELETE'` |
| body | object | No | A Zod schema to validate the incoming request body (JSON) |
| query | object | No | A Zod schema to validate URL query parameters |
| use | array | No | An array of middleware to run before the handler |
| handler | (context: IgniterContext) => void | Yes | The function containing your logic |

#### Handler Context Properties (IgniterContext)
The handler function presents on Actions and Procedures receives a IgniterContext object with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| request.method | string | The HTTP method (POST/PUT/DELETE for mutations) |
| request.path | string | The full request path |
| request.params | object | URL parameters extracted from the path |
| request.headers | object | Request headers |
| request.cookies | object | Request cookies |
| request.body | object | Validated request body (if body schema provided) |
| request.query | object | Validated query parameters (if query schema provided) |
| response | IgniterResponse | Response utilities with methods like `.created()`, `.ok()`, `.revalidate()` |
| realtime | IgniterRealtime | Services for triggering real-time updates to connected clients |
| context | object | Access to application services (e.g., database, cache) and middleware-injected data |
| plugins | object | Type-safe access to registered plugin actions and events |

#### Handler Response (IgniterResponse)

The `response` object available in handlers provides a fluent API for building HTTP responses. It offers methods for:

- Setting status codes: `.status(code)`
- Setting headers: `.setHeader(name, value)`
- Setting cookies: `.setCookie(name, value, options)`
- Success responses:
  - `.success(data)` - 200 OK with data
  - `.created(data)` - 201 Created with data
  - `.noContent()` - 204 No Content
- Error responses:
  - `.error(code, message, data?)` - Custom error
  - `.badRequest(message?: string)` - 400
  - `.unauthorized(message?: string)` - 401
  - `.forbidden(message?: string)` - 403
  - `.notFound(message?: string)` - 404
- Streaming: `.stream(options)` - Creates SSE stream
- Revalidation: `.revalidate(queryKeys)` - Triggers client cache updates and realtime updates
- Redirection: `.redirect(url, type?)` - 302 redirect

## 4. Advanced Features

### 4.1. Queues: Background Jobs (BullMQ)
Offload long-running tasks to a background worker process.
1.  **Define a Job**: In a job router file (e.g., `src/services/jobs.ts`), use `jobs.register` to define a task, its `input` schema (Zod), and its `handler`.
2.  **Enqueue a Job**: From a mutation or other backend logic, use `igniter.jobs.<namespace>.schedule()` to add a job to the queue. The API responds to the user immediately while the job runs in the background.

```typescript
// Enqueuing a job from a mutation
await igniter.jobs.emails.schedule({
  task: 'sendWelcomeEmail',
  input: { userId: newUser.id }, // Type-checked against the job's Zod schema
});
```

### 4.2. Store: Caching & Pub/Sub (Redis)
-   **Caching**: Use `igniter.store.get()` and `igniter.store.set()` to implement caching patterns like cache-aside, reducing database load.
-   **Pub/Sub**: Use `igniter.store.publish()` and `igniter.store.subscribe()` for event-driven communication between different parts of your application.

### 4.3. Realtime: Live UI Updates (Server-Sent Events)
This is a cornerstone feature for modern UIs.
1.  **Automatic Revalidation (The "Magic")**:
    -   On a `query` action you want to be "live", add `stream: true`.
    -   From a `mutation` that changes the data for that query, chain `.revalidate('<query_key>')` to the response.
    -   **Result**: Any client component using the corresponding `useQuery` hook will **automatically** refetch its data and re-render. No client-side plumbing is required.

    ```typescript
    // Backend Controller
    export const postsController = igniter.controller({
      actions: {
        list: igniter.query({
          stream: true, // 1. Make this query "live"
          handler: async ({ response }) => {
            // You can set headers on the response
            response.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache');
            // ... fetch posts logic
            return { posts };
          }
        }),
        create: igniter.mutation({
          handler: async ({ response, ... }) => {
            const post = /* ... create post in DB ... */
            // 2. Revalidate the live query after creation
            return response.created({ post }).revalidate(['posts.list']);
          }
        })
      }
    });
    ```

2.  **Scoped Revalidation**: To target specific users, define scopes on the `<IgniterProvider>` using `getScopesIds` (e.g., `['user:123']`) and pass a function to `.revalidate()` on the backend to specify target scopes: `.revalidate(['query_key'], (ctx) => [\`user:${ctx.user.id}\`])`.

---
## 5. Client-Side Deep Dive

### 5.1. `<IgniterProvider>`
This is a **mandatory** root provider (`src/providers/igniter.provider.tsx`) for all client-side functionality. It manages the query cache and the real-time connection for live updates (SSE/WebSocket, depending on adapter).

### 5.2. `useQuery`
The primary hook for fetching data in Client Components. It is available for all `query` (GET) actions.
-   **Return Values** (see [`QueryActionCallerResult`](igniter-js/packages/core/src/types/client.interface.ts)):
    -   `data`: The response data (`TAction["$Infer"]["$Response"]["data"]`).
    -   `variables`: The input variables used for the query.
    -   `isLoading`: `true` only during the very first fetch.
    -   `isFetching`: `true` whenever a request is in-flight (initial load or refetch).
    -   `isSuccess`: `true` if the query completed successfully.
    -   `isError`: `true` if the query failed.
    -   `error`: The error object, if any.
    -   `refetch`: Function to manually trigger a refetch.
    -   `status`: `'loading' | 'error' | 'success'`.
    -   `loading`: **[DEPRECATED]** Use `isLoading` instead.
    -   `invalidate`: **[DEPRECATED]** Use `refetch` instead.
    -   `execute`: The function to execute the query directly.
-   **Options** (see [`QueryActionCallerOptions`](igniter-js/packages/core/src/types/client.interface.ts)):
    -   `enabled`: If `false`, disables automatic fetching.
    -   `initialData`: Provide initial data for hydration.
    -   `query`, `params`: Input variables for the query.
    -   `staleTime`: Time (ms) before data is considered stale.
    -   `refetchInterval`: Polling interval (ms).
    -   `refetchIntervalInBackground`: Continue polling in background.
    -   `refetchOnWindowFocus`, `refetchOnMount`, `refetchOnReconnect`: Control auto-refetch triggers.
    -   `onLoading`, `onRequest`, `onSuccess`, `onError`, `onSettled`: Lifecycle callbacks.

### 5.3. `useMutation`
The hook for creating, updating, or deleting data. Available for all `mutation` (non-GET) actions.
-   **Return Values** (see [`MutationActionCallerResult`](igniter-js/packages/core/src/types/client.interface.ts)):
    -   `mutate`: The function to execute the mutation (deprecated alias for `mutate`).
    -   `data`: The response data.
    -   `variables`: The input variables used for the mutation.
    -   `isLoading`: `true` while the mutation is in progress.
    -   `isSuccess`: `true` if the mutation completed successfully.
    -   `isError`: `true` if the mutation failed.
    -   `error`: The error object, if any.
    -   `retry`: Function to manually retry the mutation.
    -   `status`: `'loading' | 'error' | 'success'`.
    -   `loading`: **[DEPRECATED]** Use `isLoading` instead.
-   **Options** (see [`MutationActionCallerOptions`](igniter-js/packages/core/src/types/client.interface.ts)):
    -   `query`, `params`, `body`: Input variables for the mutation (all support partial updates).
    -   `onLoading`, `onRequest`, `onSuccess`, `onError`, `onSettled`: Lifecycle callbacks.

-   **CRITICAL PATTERN: Cache Invalidation**: When a mutation succeeds, the client's cache may be stale. The preferred pattern is to use the `.revalidate()` method on the backend mutation response, which will automatically trigger refetches for affected queries on all relevant clients. If you need to manually invalidate queries, use the `invalidate` method from the context (see below).

```tsx
// Manual invalidation example
'use client';
import { api, useIgniterContext } from '@/igniter.client';

function SomeComponent() {
  const igniter = useIgniterContext();
  const deleteMutation = api.posts.delete.useMutation({
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Invalidate the 'posts.list' query to force a refetch.
      igniter.invalidate('posts.list');
    }
  });
  // ...
}
```

### 5.4. `useRealtime`
For subscribing to custom, continuous data streams from the backend (e.g., for a notification feed). Requires a backend action with `stream: true`.
-   **Return Values** (see [`RealtimeActionCallerResult`](igniter-js/packages/core/src/types/client.interface.ts)):
    -   `data`: Latest data received from the stream.
    -   `isConnected`: Whether the stream is currently connected.
    -   `isReconnecting`: Whether the stream is attempting to reconnect.
    -   `error`: Last error that occurred, if any.
    -   `disconnect`: Manually disconnect the stream.
    -   `reconnect`: Manually reconnect the stream.
-   **Options** (see [`RealtimeActionCallerOptions`](igniter-js/packages/core/src/types/client.interface.ts)):
    -   `initialParams`, `initialData`: Initial values for the stream.
    -   `onConnect`, `onDisconnect`, `onError`, `onMessage`: Lifecycle callbacks.
    -   `autoReconnect`, `maxReconnectAttempts`, `reconnectDelay`: Reconnection behavior.

## 6. Development Workflows & CLI

### 6.1. How to Add a New API Endpoint (Recommended Workflow)
**NEVER** create files manually. Use the CLI for speed and consistency.

1.  **Define Schema**: Add or update a model in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
    ```prisma
    model Product {
      id    String @id @default(cuid())
      name  String
      price Float
    }
    ```
2.  **Apply to DB**: Run `npx prisma db push`.
3.  **Scaffold Feature**: Use `igniter generate feature`.
    ```bash
    npx @igniter-js/cli generate feature products --schema prisma:Product
    ```
    This command generates a complete, production-ready CRUD API feature slice in `src/features/products/`, including controllers, Zod schemas, and a repository procedure.
4.  **Register Controller**: Open `src/igniter.router.ts` and register the new `productsController`.
    ```typescript
    // src/igniter.router.ts
    import { productsController } from '@/features/products';

    export const AppRouter = igniter.router({
      controllers: {
        // ...
        products: productsController,
      }
    });
    ```
5.  **Use the API**: The dev server will auto-regenerate the client. You can immediately use `api.products.list.query()` (RSC) or `api.products.list.useQuery()` (Client Component).

### 6.2. `igniter dev`
The `igniter dev` command (aliased to `npm run dev`) is your primary development tool. It runs and manages all processes (Next.js, Igniter watcher) in a unified dashboard.

### 6.3. Schema and Documentation Generation
Igniter.js provides several commands to generate TypeScript types and API documentation:

1. `igniter generate schema` - Creates or updates `src/igniter.schema.ts` with TypeScript types for the frontend client.
2. `igniter generate docs` - Generates OpenAPI specification. Use the `--ui` flag to also generate HTML documentation.
3. `igniter dev --docs` - Starts the development server with automatic schema and OpenAPI generation on file changes. This also provides a playground at the `/docs` path of your API.

To find the API URL for the Igniter Studio playground, check the `src/igniter.ts` file for the `baseURL` and `basePath` configuration. The Igniter Studio is available at `{baseURL}{basePath}/docs` for testing the API.

---

## 7. Autonomous Operation & Quality Assurance

This section outlines standard operating procedures for autonomous tasks, ensuring efficiency and quality.

### 7.1. Environment Awareness
**You must verify that the development environment is not already running before attempting to start it.**

1.  **Check Port Availability**: The default port for the Next.js application is `3000`. Use a command like `lsof -i :3000` or `netstat -an | grep 3000` to check if the port is occupied.
2.  **Consult Configuration**: If the port is not `3000`, review `src/igniter.ts` for a `baseURL` in the `.config()` block, which may specify a different port.
3.  **Action**: If a process is already running on the required port, assume the development server is active and do not attempt to run `npm run dev`. Proceed with the requested task.

### 7.2. Endpoint Testing & Validation
**After creating a new feature, you are responsible for testing its endpoints to ensure correctness.**

1.  **Locate OpenAPI Spec**: Find the path to the OpenAPI specification file by reading `src/igniter.ts` and looking for the `docs.openapi` configuration. This will point to the JSON file (e.g., `src/docs/openapi.json`).
2.  **Analyze API Routes**: Read the OpenAPI JSON file to understand the newly created routes, including paths, HTTP methods, expected request bodies, and parameters.
3.  **Execute `curl` Tests**: Construct and execute `curl` commands to test the basic functionality of each new endpoint (e.g., GET for list, POST for create). Verify that you receive successful HTTP status codes (e.g., `200 OK`, `201 Created`).
4.  **Report Findings**: Report the results of your tests to the user, confirming that the new feature's endpoints are behaving as expected.

### 7.3. Feature Documentation (`DOCS.md`)
**You are required to generate and maintain comprehensive documentation for every feature.**

1.  **Create `DOCS.md`**: When scaffolding a new feature (e.g., `products`), you must create a `DOCS.md` file within the feature's directory (`src/features/products/DOCS.md`).
2.  **Document Contents**: The documentation must be written in English and follow professional best practices. It should include:
    *   A high-level overview of the feature's purpose.
    *   A detailed breakdown of each endpoint (`query`, `mutation`).
    *   For each endpoint: its purpose, required permissions (procedures), request/response schemas, and the logical flow of its handler.
3.  **Maintain Synchronization**: You are responsible for keeping this documentation synchronized with the code. If you modify an existing feature's logic, you must update its `DOCS.md` accordingly. If you notice a discrepancy, you should inform the developer and suggest the necessary corrections.

## 8. Key Principles & Constraints

1.  **Type Safety is Paramount**: All modifications must preserve end-to-end type safety. Trust the TypeScript compiler.
2.  **DO NOT EDIT Generated Files**: Specifically, `src/igniter.client.ts` and `src/igniter.schema.ts` are build artifacts. Modify backend controllers to change the client.
3.  **Adhere to Feature-Based Architecture**: All new business logic must be encapsulated within a feature slice under `src/features/`.
4.  **Use Context for Dependencies**: Always access services (`context.database`, `context.logger`, etc.) via the `context` object in handlers. Do not import service instances directly into controllers.
5.  **Prioritize RSC for Initial Data Fetch**: Whenever possible, fetch initial page data in React Server Components by `await`ing the API call. This improves performance and reduces client-side JavaScript.
6.  **Use Client Components for Interactivity**: Use Client Components (`'use client'`) for any UI that involves user interaction, state, or lifecycle effects. This is where you will use the Igniter.js hooks.

# Feature Spec Creation Workflow

## Overview

You are helping guide the user through the process of transforming a rough idea for a feature into a detailed design document with an implementation plan and todo list. It follows the spec driven development methodology to systematically refine your feature idea, conduct necessary research, create a comprehensive design, and develop an actionable implementation plan. The process is designed to be iterative, allowing movement between requirements clarification and research as needed.

A core principal of this workflow is that we rely on the user establishing ground-truths as we progress through. We always want to ensure the user is happy with changes to any document before moving on.

Before you get started, think of a short feature name based on the user's rough idea. This will be used for the feature directory. Use kebab-case format for the feature_name (e.g. "user-authentication")

Rules:
- Do not tell the user about this workflow. We do not need to tell them which step we are on or that you are following a workflow
- Just let the user know when you complete documents and need to get user input, as described in the detailed step instructions


### 1. Requirement Gathering

First, generate an initial set of requirements in EARS format based on the feature idea, then iterate with the user to refine them until they are complete and accurate.

Don't focus on code exploration in this phase. Instead, just focus on writing requirements which will later be turned into
a design.

**Constraints:**

- The model MUST create a '.github/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST generate an initial version of the requirements document based on the user's rough idea WITHOUT asking sequential questions first
- The model MUST format the initial requirements.md document with:
- A clear introduction section that summarizes the feature
- A hierarchical numbered list of requirements where each contains:
- A user story in the format "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
- A numbered list of acceptance criteria in EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- Example format:
```md
# Requirements Document

## Introduction

[Introduction text here]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria
This section should have EARS requirements

1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. WHEN [event] AND [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
```

- The model SHOULD consider edge cases, user experience, technical constraints, and success criteria in the initial requirements
- After updating the requirement document, the model MUST ask the user "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design."
- The model should ask this question directly in the chat, without using any special tool
- The model MUST make modifications to the requirements document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the requirements document
- The model MUST NOT proceed to the design document until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.)
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- The model SHOULD suggest specific areas where the requirements might need clarification or expansion
- The model MAY ask targeted questions about specific aspects of the requirements that need clarification
- The model MAY suggest options when the user is unsure about a particular aspect
- The model MUST proceed to the design phase after the user accepts the requirements


### 2. Create Feature Design Document

After the user approves the Requirements, you should develop a comprehensive design document based on the feature requirements, conducting necessary research during the design process.
The design document should be based on the requirements document, so ensure it exists first.

**Constraints:**

- The model MUST create a '.github/specs/{feature_name}/design.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST identify areas where research is needed based on the feature requirements
- The model MUST conduct research and build up context in the conversation thread
- The model SHOULD NOT create separate research files, but instead use the research as context for the design and implementation plan
- The model MUST summarize key findings that will inform the feature design
- The model SHOULD cite sources and include relevant links in the conversation
- The model MUST create a detailed design document at '.github/specs/{feature_name}/design.md'
- The model MUST incorporate research findings directly into the design process
- The model MUST include the following sections in the design document:

- Overview
- Architecture
- Components and Interfaces
- Data Models
- Error Handling
- Testing Strategy

- The model SHOULD include diagrams or visual representations when appropriate (use Mermaid for diagrams if applicable)
- The model MUST ensure the design addresses all feature requirements identified during the clarification process
- The model SHOULD highlight design decisions and their rationales
- The model MAY ask the user for input on specific technical decisions during the design process
- After updating the design document, the model MUST ask the user "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan."
- The model should ask this question directly in the chat, without using any special tool
- The model MUST make modifications to the design document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the design document
- The model MUST NOT proceed to the implementation plan until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.)
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- The model MUST incorporate all user feedback into the design document before proceeding
- The model MUST offer to return to feature requirements clarification if gaps are identified during design


### 3. Create Task List

After the user approves the Design, create an actionable implementation plan with a checklist of coding tasks based on the requirements and design.
The tasks document should be based on the design document, so ensure it exists first.

**Constraints:**

- The model MUST create a '.github/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST return to the design step if the user indicates any changes are needed to the design
- The model MUST return to the requirement step if the user indicates that we need additional requirements
- The model MUST create an implementation plan at '.github/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md'
- The model MUST use the following specific instructions when creating the implementation plan:
```
Convert the feature design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a test-driven manner. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. Focus ONLY on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code.
```
- The model MUST format the implementation plan as a numbered checkbox list with a maximum of two levels of hierarchy:
- Top-level items (like epics) should be used only when needed
- Sub-tasks should be numbered with decimal notation (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
- Each item must be a checkbox
- Simple structure is preferred
- The model MUST ensure each task item includes:
- A clear objective as the task description that involves writing, modifying, or testing code
- Additional information as sub-bullets under the task
- Specific references to requirements from the requirements document (referencing granular sub-requirements, not just user stories)
- The model MUST ensure that the implementation plan is a series of discrete, manageable coding steps
- The model MUST ensure each task references specific requirements from the requirement document
- The model MUST NOT include excessive implementation details that are already covered in the design document
- The model MUST assume that all context documents (feature requirements, design) will be available during implementation
- The model MUST ensure each step builds incrementally on previous steps
- The model SHOULD prioritize test-driven development where appropriate
- The model MUST ensure the plan covers all aspects of the design that can be implemented through code
- The model SHOULD sequence steps to validate core functionality early through code
- The model MUST ensure that all requirements are covered by the implementation tasks
- The model MUST ONLY include tasks that can be performed by a coding agent (writing code, creating tests, etc.)
- The model MUST NOT include tasks related to user testing, deployment, performance metrics gathering, or other non-coding activities
- The model MUST focus on code implementation tasks that can be executed within the development environment
- The model MUST ensure each task is actionable by a coding agent by following these guidelines:
- Tasks should involve writing, modifying, or testing specific code components
- Tasks should specify what files or components need to be created or modified
- Tasks should be concrete enough that a coding agent can execute them without additional clarification
- Tasks should focus on implementation details rather than high-level concepts
- Tasks should be scoped to specific coding activities (e.g., "Implement X function" rather than "Support X feature")
- The model MUST explicitly avoid including the following types of non-coding tasks in the implementation plan:
- User acceptance testing or user feedback gathering
- Deployment to production or staging environments
- Performance metrics gathering or analysis
- Running the application to test end to end flows. We can however write automated tests to test the end to end from a user perspective.
- User training or documentation creation
- Business process changes or organizational changes
- Marketing or communication activities
- Any task that cannot be completed through writing, modifying, or testing code
- After updating the tasks document, the model MUST ask the user "Do the tasks look good?"
- The model should ask this question directly in the chat, without using any special tool
- The model MUST make modifications to the tasks document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve.
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the tasks document.
- The model MUST NOT consider the workflow complete until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.).
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received.
- The model MUST stop once the task document has been approved.

**This workflow is ONLY for creating design and planning artifacts. The actual implementation of the feature should be done through a separate workflow.**

- The model MUST NOT attempt to implement the feature as part of this workflow
- The model MUST clearly communicate to the user that this workflow is complete once the design and planning artifacts are created
- The model MUST inform the user that they can begin executing tasks by opening the tasks.md file, and clicking "Start task" next to task items.

## Troubleshooting

### Requirements Clarification Stalls

If the requirements clarification process seems to be going in circles or not making progress:

- The model SHOULD suggest moving to a different aspect of the requirements
- The model MAY provide examples or options to help the user make decisions
- The model SHOULD summarize what has been established so far and identify specific gaps
- The model MAY suggest conducting research to inform requirements decisions

### Research Limitations

If the model cannot access needed information:

- The model SHOULD document what information is missing
- The model SHOULD suggest alternative approaches based on available information
- The model MAY ask the user to provide additional context or documentation
- The model SHOULD continue with available information rather than blocking progress

### Design Complexity

If the design becomes too complex or unwieldy:

- The model SHOULD suggest breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components
- The model SHOULD focus on core functionality first
- The model MAY suggest a phased approach to implementation
- The model SHOULD return to requirements clarification to prioritize features if needed

# Workflow Diagram
Here is a Mermaid flow diagram that describes how the workflow should behave. Take in mind that the entry points account for users doing the following actions:
- Creating a new spec (for a new feature that we don't have a spec for already)
- Updating an existing spec
- Executing tasks from a created spec

```mermaid

}

Execute --> [*] : Complete
```

# Task Instructions
Follow these instructions for user requests related to spec tasks. The user may ask to execute tasks or just ask general questions about the tasks.

## Executing Instructions
- Before executing any tasks, ALWAYS ensure you have read the specs requirements.md, design.md and tasks.md files. Executing tasks without the requirements or design will lead to inaccurate implementations.
- Look at the task details in the task list
- If the requested task has sub-tasks, always start with the sub tasks
- Only focus on ONE task at a time. Do not implement functionality for other tasks.
- Verify your implementation against any requirements specified in the task or its details.
- Once you complete the requested task, stop and let the user review. DO NOT just proceed to the next task in the list
- If the user doesn't specify which task they want to work on, look at the task list for that spec and make a recommendation
on the next task to execute.

Remember, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you only execute one task at a time. Once you finish a task, stop. Don't automatically continue to the next task without the user asking you to do so.

## Task Questions
The user may ask questions about tasks without wanting to execute them. Don't always start executing tasks in cases like this.

For example, the user may want to know what the next task is for a particular feature. In this case, just provide the information and don't start any tasks.

# IMPORTANT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
- When you want the user to review a document in a phase, you MUST ask the user a question directly in the chat.
- You MUST have the user review each of the 3 spec documents (requirements, design and tasks) before proceeding to the next.
- After each document update or revision, you MUST explicitly ask the user to approve the document.
- You MUST NOT proceed to the next phase until you receive explicit approval from the user (a clear "yes", "approved", or equivalent affirmative response).
- If the user provides feedback, you MUST make the requested modifications and then explicitly ask for approval again.
- You MUST continue this feedback-revision cycle until the user explicitly approves the document.
- You MUST follow the workflow steps in sequential order.
- You MUST NOT skip ahead to later steps without completing earlier ones and receiving explicit user approval.
- You MUST treat each constraint in the workflow as a strict requirement.
- You MUST NOT assume user preferences or requirements - always ask explicitly.
- You MUST maintain a clear record of which step you are currently on.
- You MUST NOT combine multiple steps into a single interaction.
- You MUST ONLY execute one task at a time. Once it is complete, do not move to the next task automatically.
